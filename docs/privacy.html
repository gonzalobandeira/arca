            <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>Arcav does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or coordinate card information to
                    external servers.</strong></p>
            <p>All data you scan or enter into the app is stored locally on your device within its secure enclave. We do
                not have access to your cards, your biometric data, or your usage patterns.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Biometric Authentication</h2>
            <p>Arcav uses Apple's LocalAuthentication framework (Face ID/Touch ID). The app never receives your actual
                biometric data; it only receives a success or failure notification from the iOS operating system.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Arcav does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. No data is shared with any
                third party.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Security</h2>
            <p>Data stored within the app is encrypted using industry-standard methods provided by the iOS platform. We
                recommend using a strong device passcode and keeping your iOS software up to date.</p>
